## 🚀 Installation

### Chrome and Mozilla
WIP

### Safari (macOS only)

1. **[Download the DMG installer](https://github.com/jj-sm/Quick-UC/releases/download/v1.2/QuickUC-Installer.dmg)**
2. Open the `.dmg` file and drag `Quick-UC.app` to your `Applications` folder
3. Enable in Safari

>[!NOTE]
> You might be prompted with a warning of an unidentified developer this happens because macOS shows this alert due to the following reasons:
> - The app isn't notarized (you are required to have an $99/year Apple Developer account (I don't))
> - It's distributed outside the App Store  
> - 🔒 Your security isn't compromised - [verify the code yourself](https://github.com/jj-sm/Quick-UC)
